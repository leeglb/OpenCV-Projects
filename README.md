<h1>Rock Paper Scissors (ML & OpenCV) </h1>

With the evergrowing technology prowess of facial recognition, the importance of utilising and understanding the core principles and technology of it is a must.
Facial recognition software is crucial in modern day society for its wide-ranging applications in security, convenience and efficiency. 
Offering a fast and convenient method for authentication, scanning and providing as a powerful tool for law enforcement to identify suspects and locate missing personel.

The following python machine learning libraries will be utilised:

<i> Keep in mind, we will create a virtual environment up to python 3.10. </i> 

```
python3.10 -m venv venv
```

1. OpenCV -> A free open-source library of computer vision and machine learning functions used to help computers process visual data such as images and videos.

<i> To install it use the following command </i>

```
pip install opencv-contrib-python
```

2. Mediapipe -> Another open source, cross-platform framework developed by Google that enables developers to build and deploy on device machine learning (ML) pipelines
for real time AI applications.

<i> To install it use the following command </i> 

```
pip install mediapipe
```

Additional libraries such as: 

1. import random 
2. import time 
3. from datetime import datetime

The ultimate goal of this project is to create a rock-paper-scissors game to understand hand and finger tracking, a beginner step in unlocking knowledge on machine learning 
algorithms and camera recognition.
